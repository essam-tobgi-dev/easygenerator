      "rating": 5,
      "text": "We've been using CircleCI for about 2 years now and it's transformed our deployment workflow. The parallel builds cut our CI time from 45 minutes down to about 12 minutes. Docker layer caching is a game changer. Only complaint is the pricing gets steep as you scale, but the productivity gains justify it.",

      "rating": 4,
      "text": "Solid monitoring platform with great integrations. Setting up distributed tracing took some time but the APM insights are valuable. Dashboard customization is powerful but has a learning curve. Wish the log ingestion pricing was more transparent - we got surprised by overages.",

      "category": "API Gateway",
      "rating": 4,
      "text": "Kong handles our API traffic well at scale - we're processing around 50k requests per second. The plugin ecosystem is extensive. Rate limiting and auth plugins work out of the box. Documentation could be better organized though, and debugging issues in production requires deep diving into logs.",

      "product": "New Relic",
      "category": "Monitoring Tool",
      "rating": 3,
      "text": "Mixed feelings about New Relic. The APM is excellent and has helped us catch performance regressions before production. However, the UI is cluttered and finding specific metrics takes too many clicks. NRQL is powerful but the syntax isn't intuitive. Also experienced some data gaps during high-traffic periods.",

      "category": "Error Tracking",
      "rating": 4,
      "text": "Sentry catches errors we'd never find otherwise. Breadcrumbs and stack traces with source maps are invaluable for debugging. Release tracking shows us exactly which deployment caused issues. The Slack integration is noisy by default - spent time tuning alert rules. Python SDK is great, React SDK needed more setup.",

      "category": "Cloud SDK",
      "rating": 3,
      "text": "AWS SDK does what it needs to do but the developer experience varies. Some services have clean APIs, others feel bolted on. Error messages are often cryptic - spent hours debugging IAM permission issues. TypeScript support has improved but types can be overly complex. Documentation exists but finding the right page is an adventure.",

      "rating": 5,
      "text": "Vercel makes frontend deployment trivial. Push to main and your site is live in seconds. Preview deployments for PRs are fantastic for review. Edge functions are fast and the DX is unmatched. Only downside is vendor lock-in concerns and pricing for high-traffic sites. Great for Next.js projects especially.",

      "rating": 4,
      "text": "PagerDuty's on-call scheduling and escalation policies work reliably. The mobile app ensures I never miss critical alerts. Integration with our monitoring stack was straightforward. UI feels dated compared to newer tools. Pricing is on the higher end but the reliability is worth it for production systems.",

      "text": "Elasticsearch is powerful but demanding. Query DSL has a steep learning curve. Cluster management requires constant attention - we've had split-brain issues and unassigned shards. Memory tuning is critical. Once properly configured, search performance is excellent. The ELK stack together works well for log aggregation.",

      "category": "Edge Computing",
      "rating": 4,
      "text": "Workers let us run code at the edge with minimal latency. The wrangler CLI is decent for local development. KV storage works for simple use cases. Limitations hit you when building complex apps - no native WebSocket support initially was painful. Pricing is very competitive compared to Lambda@Edge.",

      "text": "Having CI/CD built into GitLab reduces context switching. Pipeline visualization helps debug failed jobs. Auto DevOps templates get you started quickly. Self-hosted runners give us control over build environments. Shared runners can be slow during busy periods. YAML anchors help reduce pipeline duplication.",

      "text": "Twilio's SMS and voice APIs are reliable with good global coverage. Console for debugging messages is helpful. Pricing per message adds up for high volume. Studio flow builder simplifies IVR setup without code. Carrier filtering can be aggressive - some legitimate messages got blocked. Support tier matters.",

      "text": "Supabase is like Firebase but with Postgres. Auth, storage, and real-time features accelerate development. Row level security policies are powerful once you understand them. The dashboard is clean and functional. Edge functions are newer and less mature than the core features. Great for rapid prototyping.",

      "text": "Prisma transformed how we interact with databases. Type-safe queries catch errors at compile time. Migrations are straightforward. The studio UI helps visualize data. Schema is readable and version controlled. Some complex queries need raw SQL but that's rare. Best Node.js ORM experience available.",

      "text": "Heroku pioneered easy deployments but feels stuck in time. Dynos are straightforward for simple apps. Pricing escalates quickly - we're paying $500/month for modest traffic. No European data residency for years was a blocker. Add-ons ecosystem is convenient. Fine for prototypes but we're migrating to containers.",
